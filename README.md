# Student Academic Performance Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for comprehensive analysis of student academic performance. This project explores a wide array of factors influencing students' grades in mathematics and Portuguese courses. By integrating and examining datasets from these two subjects, I aim to uncover patterns and insights into how various social, personal, and academic factors impact student outcomes.

## Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify key determinants of academic success among high school students. Through meticulous data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling, we strive to provide actionable insights for educators, students, and policy-makers interested in enhancing educational achievement.

## Data Overview

The project utilizes two datasets encompassing student performance in math and Portuguese courses, including detailed information on academic, personal, and social factors. The datasets have been carefully cleaned, merged, and processed to facilitate a comprehensive analysis.

## Analytical Tools

- **Pandas**: Employed for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for generating insightful visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Applied for building predictive models and conducting feature importance analysis.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Grade Distribution**: An examination of the distribution of final grades and the factors influencing academic performance.
- **Influence of Alcohol Consumption**: Analysis of the relationship between students' alcohol consumption habits and their academic outcomes.
- **Impact of Romantic Relationships**: Investigation into how romantic involvements affect students' grades.
- **Parental Background**: Assessment of the effect of parents' jobs and educational levels on student performance.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Utilization of RandomForestClassifier to identify the most significant predictors of academic success.

## Key Findings

- Alcohol consumption is inversely related to academic performance, with higher consumption associated with lower grades.
- Romantic relationships do not have a straightforward impact on academic performance, indicating the need for further investigation into contextual factors.
- Parental education and occupation play significant roles in shaping students' academic outcomes.
- Student attendance is crucial, as higher absence rates are linked to lower academic achievement.

## Repository Structure

- **Exploratory Notebooks**: Detailed Jupyter notebooks containing the EDA, visualizations, and model-building processes.
- **Data**: The raw datasets for both mathematics and Portuguese courses.
- **Models**: Serialized versions of the predictive models developed during the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the complexity of factors influencing student academic performance. The insights gained underscore the importance of a holistic approach to education that considers both academic and non-academic factors. We hope that this analysis will contribute to ongoing discussions and efforts to improve educational strategies and student outcomes.
